# P+
>### Password Plus - A Password Generator and Storage Application <br><br>
>  I built this application with the intention of upscaling my first ever JavaScript application for the UNC Coding Bootcamp. Originally, this application was a password generator that accepted user input via alerts and returned a randomized passcode. I repurposed that project to provide users a seamless UI experience on both mobile and desktop devices with the enhanced ability to store generated passwords to their accounts and assign them to various apps and services. Utilizing a GraphQL API built with an Apollo Server, this app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Additionally, this application meets PWA criteria and features multiple data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. This application is available for installation and is fully functional offline.  <br><br>
